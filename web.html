<h1>What Is <strong>GitHub</strong>, and What Is It Used For?</h1>
<p>GitHub is a website and service that we hear geeks rave about 
all the time, yet a lot of people don’t really understand what it does. 
Want to know what all the GitHub hubbub is about? Read on to find out.</p>
<hr/>
<h1><a name="thegit"></a>The “Git” in GitHub</h1>
<p>To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. 
Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus
 Trovalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version 
control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.
So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? 
When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes
 to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.
Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications 
in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate,
 as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload
 the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them,
 and contribute.
 <p>Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project
 can still download the files and use them. Most Linux users should be familiar
 with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other similar method is pretty
 common for downloading needed files—especially in preparation for compiling
 a program from source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks).
Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, 
since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available.
 It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better. 
If you’re interested in knowing the details, the Git Basics page has a 
thorough explanation on how Git works.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="hubin"></a> The “Hub” in <em>GitHub</em></h2>
<p>We’ve established that Git is a version control system, 
similar but better than the many alternatives available. 
So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, 
but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com
—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.</p>
</hr>
<h3><a name="repo"></a>Repository</h3>
<p>A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files 
for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, 
and you can access it with a unique URL</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="fork"></a><strong>Forking</strong> a Repo
<p>“Forking” is when you create a new project based off of another project 
that already exists. This is an amazing feature that vastly encourages
 the further development of programs and other projects. If you find a project
 on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to, you can fork the repo,
 make the changes you’d like, and release the revised project as a new repo.
 If the original repository that you forked to create your new project gets updated, 
you can easily add those updates to your current fork.</p>
<hr/>
<h1><a name="pull"></a>Pull Requests</h1>
<p>You’ve forked a repository, made a great revision to the project, 
and want it to be recognized by the original developers—maybe even included 
in the official project/repository. You can do so by creating a pull request. 
The authors of the original repository can see your work, 
and then choose whether or not to accept it into the official project.
 Whenever you issue a pull request, GitHub provides a perfect medium for you 
and the main project’s maintainer to communicate.</p>
